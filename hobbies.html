                        Adam first picked up <a href="https://www.svsports.com/blogs/resources/beginners-guide-to-disc-golf" target="_blank">disc golf</a>
                        in late middle school with a couple of friends and a few discs. It was fun, and it didn’t matter whether they were very good at it.
                        He drifted away from the sport during college, but when he was away for Air Force training for several months in 2020, he began disc golfing again.
                        This time, he began to focus on honing his skills and learning all the different factors that go into throwing a disc with precision.

                        Now, Adam enjoys practicing on his own or playing a round with friends. He’s steadily expanding his collection of discs
                        since each individual disc flies a little differently - and also because they’re cool. He’s involved in the online disc
                        golf community as well, from trading discs with enthusiasts across the country to following the careers of pro disc golfers.

                        Adam was never big into the culinary arts growing up, but as soon as he lived on his own
                        for the first time, he became interested in food not only as a necessity but as a hobby.
                        As a new cook, he started with simple recipes and the goal of making them perfectly. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He likes to think of cooking as a big science experiment: choose your variables such as ingredients,
                        temperature, and time, and see if you can come up with a result even tastier than last time.
                        This way of thinking is heavily inspired by one of his favorite celebrity chefs, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt,
                        author of <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/" target="_blank">The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science</a></i>. 
                        In addition to mouth-watering recipes, this huge cookbook includes techniques to bring basic recipes to the next level and the science behind those techniques.
