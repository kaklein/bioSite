                About Adam Klein
            </h1>
            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>
                A native Minnesotan, Adam has spent the last three years living in various places across the United States as a Weather Officer for the U.S. Air Force. He’s a self-proclaimed weather nerd who holds a bachelor’s degree in Meteorology from the U.S. Air Force Academy (2018) and a master’s degree in Atmospheric Science from the Air Force Institute of Technology (2020). In his current project manager role, he enjoys the camaraderie that comes from working in a small team.
            </p>
            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>
                In his free time, Adam is a lover of all things sports whether it’s as a spectator, analyzing sports statistics, or getting in on the action himself. Disc golf, beach volleyball, and racquetball are a few of his favorites to play, along with anything else that involves some friendly competition.
            </p>
            <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
            <p>
                He’s also into the culinary scene. Sampling local restaurants with family or friends, crafting new cocktails, or trying out a new recipe at home are all tried-and-true ways for him to spend a Saturday night.
            </p>
            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <p>
                From the highs (being a 3-time Geography Bee champion in middle school) to the lows (jumping out of a plane solo and not pulling the ripcord at the right time), Adam has always embraced whatever life has to offer, and he’s always game to try something new. You’ll usually find him playing sports with friends, cooking at home, or getting most of the answers right while watching Jeopardy with his wife and two cats.
